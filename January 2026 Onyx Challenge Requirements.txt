Pharmacy Sales & Profitability Analytics Data Challenge
In this challenge, you will analyze a dataset representing a European pharmacy chain distributor operating across multiple European countries. The dataset includes daily sales transactions by pharmacy and product, with supporting dimensions for time, geography and product hierarchy.

Your task is to build a Power BI report that helps stakeholders understand:

How sales and profitability vary across countries, regions, and individual pharmacies
How different product categories and brands perform in different locations
How regional performance contributes to overall business results
Key Questions:
How do revenue, units sold, and margin change over time, and are there clear seasonal patterns?
Which countries and regions contribute the most to total revenue and margin?
How does performance vary when drilling down from country → region → pharmacy?
Which pharmacies outperform or underperform compared to others in the same region?
How do Urban, Suburban, and Rural pharmacies differ in sales volume and profitability?
Which product categories and brands generate the most revenue, and which generate the most margin?
Are there products with high volume but low margin, or low volume but high margin?
How do promoted sales compare to non-promoted sales in terms of volume and margin?
How does regional performance contribute to overall business results?
Are there visible geographic patterns in sales or profitability when viewed on a map?
Note: These questions are starting points. Participants are encouraged to explore the dataset further and highlight patterns or comparisons that are not immediately obvious, as long as they are supported by the data.
